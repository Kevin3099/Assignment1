        Hello World:

        The hello world java program was the first one we did in our group.
        Kevin created the file and entered the code. Meanwhile Daniel prepared the
        circuit for the LED excercise. It was then uploaded to Github.
        <br>
        Led:

        Firstly Kevin entered the correct directory, then the two files needed
        for the Led workshop. Daniel had the circuit created for the experiment
        and connected it to Kevin's pie. We then entered the code for the experiment
        and ran the files using the sudo python command. It worked great as seen in the photo's above.
