    <h3>Hello World</h3>

        The hello world java program was the first one we did in our group.
        Kevin created the file and entered the code. Meanwhile Daniel prepared the
        circuit for the LED excercise. It was then uploaded to Github.

    <h3>Lights on/off</h3>

        Firstly Kevin entered the correct directory, then the two files needed
        for the Led workshop. Daniel had the circuit created for the experiment
        and connected it to Kevin's pie. We then entered the code for the experiment
        and ran the files using the sudo python command. It worked great as seen in the photo's above.

        Blink:

	This is a script to make an LED on a circuit board blink on and off automatically using a loop
	Kevin created the file and entered the code and Daniel set up the circuit.

        <br>
        Button:

	This is a script to make an LED on a circuit turn on when a button is clicked using a circuit board. The code was entered into a new file by Kevin and Daniel set up the circuit. You can see some photo's of these below.
